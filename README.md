# eHelp

Building microservices so we can test the system, document specs and the exchange of messages between them.

## Guidelines

### Spec tests 

Spec tests (which may include acceptance or smoke tests) should:
 * be written as documentation so developers can consult them to understand the API provided;
 * be automatically published after every successful CI build so a developer can easily consult the specs.
 
[This](http://rafaelfiume.github.io/tictactoe) and [this](http://rafaelfiume.github.io/basket-tax-and-price-calculator) are two examples of spec tests that follow these guidelines.
